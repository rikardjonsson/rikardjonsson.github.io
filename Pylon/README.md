## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 16+
- macOS 15.0+
- Apple Developer Account (for WeatherKit and App Store distribution)

### Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rikardjonsson/Pylon.git
cd Pylon

# Open in Xcode
open Pylon.xcodeproj

# Build and run (‚åò+R)
```

### Required Permissions
Pylon requires several system permissions for full functionality:
- **Calendar**: EventKit access for calendar and reminders
- **Automation**: AppleScript execution for Notes and Mail integration
- **Location**: Core Location for weather data
- **Notifications**: User notifications for updates and alerts

## Architecture

### Widget System
Pylon uses a protocol-based widget architecture for modularity and extensibility:

```swift
protocol Widget: Identifiable, Sendable {
    var id: UUID { get }
    var title: String { get }
    var isRefreshing: Bool { get }
    var lastUpdated: Date? { get }
    
    @MainActor func refresh() async throws
    @MainActor func body() -> AnyView
}
```

### Concurrency Model
Built with Swift 6.0 strict concurrency:
- `@MainActor` for UI components
- `actor` types for background services
- `@unchecked Sendable` for system integrations

### Integration Layers
- **EventKit**: Calendar and reminders with real-time sync
- **AppleScript**: Notes and Mail.app integration via Process execution
- **WeatherKit**: Current conditions and forecasts
- **System APIs**: CPU, memory, disk, and network monitoring

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Cold Boot | < 2 seconds | App launch to first render |
| Widget Refresh | < 1 second | Data fetch to UI update |
| CPU Usage | < 5% idle | Background monitoring |
| Memory Usage | < 100MB | Runtime memory footprint |
