A next-generation macOS productivity dashboard that transforms how you interact with your daily digital workflow. Built with SwiftUI and Swift 6.0, Pylon integrates deeply with the macOS ecosystem to provide a unified command center for your productivity data.

**🎯 Project Status**: Foundation Complete - Swift 6.0 compliant with container-based widget architecture  
**⭐ Slogan**: *"life is a circle because no one learns anything"*

## ✨ Why Pylon?

Unlike traditional productivity apps that force context-switching, Pylon brings everything to you with **native macOS integration**:

- 📅 **EventKit Integration** - Real-time calendar and reminders sync
- 📝 **AppleScript Automation** - Notes and Mail.app integration  
- 🌤️ **WeatherKit Support** - Current conditions and forecasts
- 🖥️ **System Monitoring** - CPU, RAM, disk, and network status
- 🎨 **Modern Material Design** - Beautiful, native macOS experience

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **macOS 15.0+** (macOS Sequoia or later)
- **Xcode 16+** for development
- **Apple Developer Account** (optional, for WeatherKit)

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rikardjonsson/Pylon.git
cd Pylon

# 2. Install development tools (optional)
make install-tools

# 3. Build and run
swift build
swift run
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Quality checks (recommended before committing)
make quality          # Run formatting and linting
make build            # Build the project
make test             # Run test suite
make pre-commit       # Complete pre-commit workflow
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Container-Based Widget System
Pylon uses a revolutionary **container architecture** where every widget is designed as a modular container with swappable content:

```swift
@MainActor
protocol WidgetContainer: Identifiable {
    var size: WidgetSize { get set }        // Small, Medium, Large, XLarge
    var theme: WidgetThemeOverride? { get set } // Custom theme overrides
    var isEnabled: Bool { get set }         // Toggle visibility
    
    func refresh() async throws             // Async data refresh
    func body(theme: any Theme, gridUnit: CGFloat, spacing: CGFloat) -> AnyView
}
```

### Dynamic Sizing System
Widgets support **4 predefined sizes** that can be dynamically switched:

| Size | Grid Units | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Small** | 1×1 | Quick glance info (time, weather) |
| **Medium** | 2×1 | Compact lists (upcoming events) |
| **Large** | 2×2 | Detailed views (calendar grid) |
| **XLarge** | 4×2 | Rich interfaces (email inbox) |

### Swift 6.0 Concurrency Model
Built with **strict concurrency compliance**:

- `@MainActor` for all UI components and state management
- Structured concurrency with `async/await` for data operations  
- `Sendable` protocol conformance for shared data types
- Thread-safe widget refresh with `TaskGroup` patterns
